# threejstest
A thing made with three.js and ammo.js. It is totally broken but if you really wish to play around with it, download these javascript files:
* three.js
* ammo.js
* Detector.js (in the three.js examples directory on the github)
* stats.js
* betterterrain.js (one of my own libraries, can be found on this github)
